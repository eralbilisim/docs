# HealthPass.run NFT Tiers & Rarity

The HealthPass.run NFT collection is structured into four distinct tiers, each designed to offer a different level of benefits, access, and HPAi revenue share. The tiers are hierarchical, with higher tiers being rarer and providing more significant advantages. This structure allows for a differentiated experience and caters to various levels of engagement within our ecosystem.

The four tiers, in descending order of rarity and value, are:

## Rarity and Value Proposition

The rarity of each NFT tier is by design. A limited supply for higher tiers aims to create scarcity, potentially driving demand and value for these exclusive NFTs. The benefits are scaled to reflect this rarity, ensuring that holders of premium tiers receive proportionally greater advantages.

**Note:** Specific discount percentages, HPAi revenue share ratios, and the exact number of NFTs per tier will be finalized and communicated prior to the official minting event. These parameters are carefully calibrated to ensure the sustainability and attractiveness of the ecosystem.
