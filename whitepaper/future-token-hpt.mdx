# The Future Utility Token: $HPT (HealthPass Token)

As part of our long-term vision to build a comprehensive and self-sustaining HealthTech ecosystem, HealthPass plans to introduce its own native utility token, tentatively named **$HPT (HealthPass Token)**. This token will play a crucial role in expanding the functionalities of our platform and further empowering our community.

## Rationale for $HPT:

While HealthPass NFTs provide foundational access and benefits, a dedicated utility token will enable more granular interactions, incentive mechanisms, and decentralized governance within the ecosystem. $HPT is envisioned to complement the NFTs, not replace them.

## Potential Utilities of $HPT:

The specific utilities of $HPT will be detailed in a separate, dedicated tokenomics paper closer to its launch. However, potential use cases currently under consideration include:

1.  **Governance:**
    *   $HPT holders may be able to participate in the governance of the HealthPass ecosystem, proposing and voting on key decisions, upgrades, and fund allocations, especially within a future DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) structure.

2.  **Staking Rewards:**
    *   Users may be able to stake their $HPT tokens to earn additional $HPT rewards, contributing to network security and stability (if applicable to the token's design) and incentivizing long-term holding.

3.  **Access to Premium Features/Services:**
    *   HPT could be used to unlock exclusive features, advanced HPAi analytics (with appropriate privacy safeguards), or premium content within the HealthPass platform.

4.  **Payment for Services:**
    *   In the future, $HPT might be accepted as a payment method for specific services within the ecosystem or with partner providers.

5.  **Incentivizing Participation:**
    *   $HPT could be used to reward users for specific actions that benefit the ecosystem, such as contributing data (anonymized and with consent), referring new users, or participating in community initiatives.

6.  **Marketplace Transactions:**
    *   Potentially used as a medium of exchange on a dedicated HealthPass marketplace for health-related goods or services (future consideration).

## Relationship with HealthPass NFTs:

*   **Synergy:** NFTs and $HPT will be designed to work synergistically.
*   **Privileged Access for NFT Holders:** HealthPass NFT holders are expected to receive significant advantages regarding the $HPT launch. This could include:
    *   **Airdrops:** A portion of the $HPT supply may be airdropped to existing HealthPass NFT holders.
    *   **Preferential Sale Terms:** NFT holders might get early access or discounted rates during any $HPT public sale or initial offering.
    *   **Enhanced Staking/Earning:** NFT holders might receive boosted $HPT rewards when staking their NFTs or tokens.

## Development and Launch:

The development of HPT and its associated smart contracts will follow the launch and initial stabilization of the HealthPass NFT ecosystem. A detailed roadmap and tokenomics for HPT will be released to the community in due course. A portion of the NFT mint proceeds (as outlined in "Mint Proceeds Allocation") is specifically earmarked for the research, development, and initial liquidity of the HPT token.

The introduction of $HPT represents a significant step in evolving HealthPass into a multifaceted, token-powered platform.
