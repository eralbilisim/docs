# Allocation of NFT Mint Proceeds

The funds raised from the initial sale (minting) of HealthPass.run NFTs are crucial for the successful development, launch, and growth of our ecosystem. We are committed to transparent and strategic allocation of these proceeds to maximize value for our community and ensure the long-term viability of the project.

The mint proceeds will be allocated as follows:

1.  **60% - Hospital & Healthcare Provider Partnerships and Ecosystem Growth:**
    *   **Securing Partnerships:** A significant portion will be dedicated to establishing and expanding our network of partner hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare providers. This may involve onboarding fees, integration costs, or initial incentive programs to secure favorable discount rates for NFT holders.
    *   **HPAi Development & Deployment:** Continued research, development, training, and deployment of our Health Artificial Intelligence (HPAi) system. This includes data acquisition (anonymized), model refinement, and integration with partner institutions.
    *   **Platform Development:** Enhancing the HealthPass.run platform, including website, user dashboards, potential mobile applications, and backend infrastructure for NFT verification and benefit management.
    *   **Marketing & Community Building:** Raising awareness of HealthPass.run, attracting new users and partners, and fostering an engaged global community. This includes digital marketing, content creation, PR, and community events.
    *   **Operational Expenses:** Covering day-to-day operational costs associated with running the project during its growth phase.

2.  **20% - Core Team & Technical Development:**
    *   **Team Compensation & Expansion:** Fairly compensating the core team for their ongoing work and attracting new talent in areas like blockchain development, AI engineering, healthcare partnerships, and community management.
    *   **Smart Contract Audits & Security:** Ensuring the security and integrity of our blockchain components through comprehensive third-party audits and ongoing security measures.
    *   **Technical Infrastructure:** Maintaining and upgrading the servers, databases, and other technical infrastructure required to support the platform.

3.  **20% - Future $HPT Token Ecosystem & Liquidity Fund:**
    *   **HPT Token Development:** Funding the research, development, and legal groundwork for our future utility token, $HPT (HealthPass Token).
    *   **Liquidity Provision:** Allocating funds to provide initial liquidity for $HPT on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) upon its launch, ensuring a stable trading environment.
    *   **Ecosystem Grants & Incentives:** Creating a reserve to fund future ecosystem development initiatives, community grants, bug bounties, and incentives to encourage participation and innovation within the HealthPass.run ecosystem.

## Transparency and Accountability:

*   **Multi-Signature Wallets:** Funds will be held in multi-signature wallets controlled by trusted core team members and potentially advisors to ensure security and prevent unauthorized access.
*   **Regular Reporting:** We plan to provide periodic reports to the community on fund utilization and project progress, fostering transparency and accountability. (Specifics of reporting to be detailed in community channels).

This allocation strategy is designed to balance immediate development needs with long-term growth and sustainability, ensuring that HealthPass.run can deliver on its promises and build a thriving ecosystem.
