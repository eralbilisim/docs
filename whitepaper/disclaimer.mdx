# Disclaimer

Please read this disclaimer carefully before reading, using, or relying on any information contained in this HealthPass Whitepaper (hereinafter referred to as the "Whitepaper").

**1. No Financial, Investment, or Legal Advice:**
This Whitepaper is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice, investment advice, a recommendation, or an offer or solicitation to buy, sell, or hold any HealthPass NFTs, $HPT tokens (when and if developed), or any other cryptographic token or digital asset. The information provided herein is not intended to be and should not be construed as financial, legal, tax, or any other professional advice. You should consult with your own qualified financial, legal, and tax advisors before making any decision related to the acquisition of HealthPass NFTs or participation in the project.

**2. NFTs and Digital Assets are Speculative and Risky:**
The acquisition of HealthPass NFTs and any future $HPT tokens involves a high degree of risk. The value of NFTs and other digital assets can be extremely volatile and can fluctuate significantly, potentially resulting in a partial or total loss of the amount paid. There is no guarantee that HealthPass NFTs or HPT tokens will hold or increase in value. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

**3. Forward-Looking Statements:**
This Whitepaper contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of HealthPass's management, as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to HealthPass's management. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance, or achievements of HealthPass to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in market conditions, technological advancements, regulatory changes, competition, and the ability of HealthPass to execute its business plan. HealthPass undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

**4. No Guarantees of Project Success or Utility:**
While HealthPass is committed to developing the project as outlined in this Whitepaper, there is no guarantee that the project will be successful or that all proposed features and utilities (including hospital discounts, HPAi revenue share, and the $HPT token) will be fully developed, implemented, or achieve their intended objectives. The development of the project is subject to various technical, operational, and market risks.

**5. Regulatory Uncertainty:**
The regulatory landscape for blockchain technology, NFTs, and cryptocurrencies is evolving and varies significantly across jurisdictions. It is possible that future regulatory changes could adversely affect the HealthPass project, the utility of its NFTs or $HPT tokens, or the ability of participants to hold or trade them. Participants are responsible for understanding and complying with all applicable laws and regulations in their respective jurisdictions.

**6. No Partnership or Agency:**
Acquisition of HealthPass NFTs does not create any form of partnership, joint venture, agency, or employment relationship between the acquirer and HealthPass or its affiliates. NFT holders are not entitled to any equity, voting rights (except as may be specifically granted through a future DAO structure), or profit-sharing beyond the HPAi revenue share mechanism described herein.

**7. Third-Party Dependencies:**
The HealthPass project may rely on third-party services, platforms (e.g., blockchain networks, NFT marketplaces, partner hospitals), and technologies. HealthPass is not responsible for the performance, security, or availability of these third-party services.

**8. Own Due Diligence:**
You are solely responsible for conducting your own thorough due diligence and research before deciding to acquire HealthPass NFTs or participate in the project. You should carefully consider your own financial situation and risk tolerance.

By acquiring HealthPass NFTs or otherwise participating in the HealthPass project, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to the terms of this disclaimer. If you do not agree with this disclaimer, you should not acquire HealthPass NFTs or participate in the project.
