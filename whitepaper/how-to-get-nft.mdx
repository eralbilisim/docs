# Acquiring Your HealthPass NFT

HealthPass NFTs are your key to accessing the unique benefits of our ecosystem. There are primarily two ways to acquire these NFTs:

## 1. Primary Minting Event (Initial Sale)

The initial release of HealthPass NFTs will occur through a **public minting event**.

*   **What is Minting?** Minting is the process of creating a new NFT on the blockchain and recording its initial ownership. When you mint a HealthPass NFT, you are the very first owner of that specific token.
*   **Date and Time:** The official date, time, and specific instructions for the mint will be announced well in advance through our official community channels (Discord, Twitter, Telegram, Website).
*   **Mint Price:** The price to mint an NFT from each tier (Chief Physician, Doctor, Nurse, Healthcare Worker) will be specified prior to the mint. Prices will typically be denominated in the native cryptocurrency of the blockchain we are using (e.g., ETH, MATIC, SOL, BNB).
*   **Wallet Requirement:** To participate in the mint, you will need a compatible Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet) that supports the [Your Chosen Blockchain] network. Your wallet must be funded with enough cryptocurrency to cover the mint price plus any applicable network transaction fees (gas fees).
*   **Whitelist/Presale (If Applicable):** There may be a whitelist or presale phase offering early or guaranteed minting access to community members who have met specific criteria. Details of any such phase will be announced separately.
*   **Public Sale:** Following any presale, the remaining NFTs will be available for minting by the general public on a first-come, first-served basis, up to the total supply limit for each tier.
*   **Minting Portal:** The minting will typically take place through a secure, official minting page on the HealthPass website. **Always ensure you are using the official link provided by our team to avoid scams.**

## 2. Secondary Marketplaces

After the initial minting event, HealthPass NFTs can be bought and sold on **secondary NFT marketplaces** that support our chosen blockchain and NFT standard.

*   **Popular Marketplaces:** Examples include OpenSea, Magic Eden, LooksRare, etc., depending on the blockchain. We will announce official collection links on these marketplaces.
*   **Buying from Other Users:** On these platforms, you can purchase NFTs directly from existing owners. Prices on secondary markets are determined by supply and demand, and can fluctuate.
*   **Selling Your NFT:** If you own a HealthPass NFT, you can list it for sale on these marketplaces.
*   **Royalties:** Be aware that a royalty fee (as detailed in the "Royalty Distribution and Usage" section) will apply to all secondary market sales, with the proceeds used to benefit the HealthPass ecosystem.
*   **Due Diligence:** When buying on secondary markets, always verify the authenticity of the NFT collection to avoid purchasing fakes. Use official links provided by HealthPass.

## Important Security Reminders:

*   **Never share your wallet's private key or seed phrase with anyone.** The HealthPass team will NEVER ask for this information.
*   **Be wary of unsolicited direct messages (DMs)** offering special deals or asking for wallet information. All official announcements will come through our designated channels.
*   **Triple-check website URLs** before connecting your wallet or making any transactions.
