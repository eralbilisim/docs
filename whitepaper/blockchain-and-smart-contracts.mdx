# Blockchain Technology and Smart Contracts

HealthPass is built upon a foundation of robust blockchain technology and carefully audited smart contracts to ensure security, transparency, and efficient operation of our ecosystem.

## Choice of Blockchain

HealthPass NFTs will be minted on the **Solana** blockchain. This decision is based on a careful evaluation of several critical factors:

- **Security:** The chosen blockchain must offer a high degree of security and immutability to protect user assets and transaction integrity.
- **Scalability & Speed:** To ensure a smooth user experience and accommodate a growing number of transactions, the blockchain needs to handle transactions efficiently with reasonable confirmation times.
- **Transaction Costs (Gas Fees):** We aim to select a blockchain that offers manageable transaction costs for minting, trading, and interacting with our NFTs and future tokens.
- **Ecosystem & Developer Community:** A mature ecosystem with strong developer tools, established NFT marketplaces, and a vibrant community is crucial for long-term growth and interoperability.
- **Smart Contract Capabilities:** The blockchain must fully support advanced smart contract functionalities required for our tiered NFT system, revenue distribution, and future DAO operations.

_Further details on the specific blockchain and its technical rationale will be provided closer to the mint date, following final evaluations and potential community input._

## Smart Contract Functionality

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They are fundamental to the HealthPass.run ecosystem and will manage:

1. **NFT Minting & Management:**
   - Governing the creation (minting) of HealthPass.run NFTs according to the defined tiers and supply limits.
   - Managing NFT ownership and transferability according to standards like ERC-721 or ERC-1155 (or their equivalents on the chosen blockchain).
2. **HPAi Revenue Distribution:**
   - Automating the collection of a designated portion of HPAi revenues.
   - Distributing these revenues fairly and transparently to eligible NFT holders based on their NFT tier and the predefined sharing ratios.
3. **Discount Verification (Potential On-Chain Aspects):**
   - While primary discount verification might occur off-chain for efficiency, smart contracts could play a role in managing the registry of valid NFTs or interacting with partner systems for enhanced trust.
4. **Staking Mechanisms (Future):**
   - Managing the locking of NFTs (staking) and the calculation and distribution of staking rewards.
5. **Governance (Future DAO):**
   - Facilitating proposal submissions, voting processes, and the execution of community-approved decisions within a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) framework.

## Security & Audits

Security is paramount for HealthPass.run.

- **Smart Contract Audits:** All our smart contracts will undergo rigorous security audits by reputable third-party blockchain security firms before deployment. Audit reports will be made publicly available to ensure transparency and build community trust.
- **Best Practices:** We will adhere to industry best practices in smart contract development, including thorough testing, code reviews, and known vulnerability mitigation.
- **Ongoing Monitoring:** Post-deployment, we will implement monitoring solutions to detect and respond to any potential security threats or unusual activity.

By leveraging the inherent strengths of blockchain and meticulously developing our smart contracts, we aim to create a secure, transparent, and reliable platform for all HealthPass.run participants.
