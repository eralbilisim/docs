# Frequently Asked Questions - General

**1. What is HealthPass.run in simple terms?**
HealthPass.run is a project that uses unique digital items called NFTs to give you real-world benefits, like discounts at hospitals. It also has a special AI technology (HPAi) that helps analyze medical data, and NFT holders can get a share of the money HPAi makes.

**2. What is an NFT?**
NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token. It's a unique digital certificate of ownership for an item (like digital art, or in our case, a membership pass with benefits), recorded on a secure digital ledger called a blockchain.

**3. What are the main benefits of owning a HealthPass.run NFT?**
Key benefits include:

- Ongoing discounts at partner hospitals and clinics.
- A share of the revenue generated by our HPAi (Health Artificial Intelligence) system.
- Access to an exclusive community and events.
- Potential early access and benefits related to our future \$HPT token.

**4. How do the hospital discounts work?**
Once you own a HealthPass.run NFT, you'll be able to present it (likely through a digital verification process linked to your crypto wallet) at partner healthcare facilities to receive the entitled discount on eligible services. The exact mechanism will be detailed closer to the benefit activation.

**5. If I sell my HealthPass.run NFT, do I keep the benefits?**
No. The benefits associated with a HealthPass.run NFT are tied to the current ownership of that specific NFT. If you sell or transfer your NFT, all rights and benefits transfer to the new owner.

**6. Who is the team behind HealthPass.run?**
HealthPass.run is driven by a team with expertise in healthcare, artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, business, and marketing. More details can be found in the "Team and Advisors" section of this whitepaper.

**7. Is HealthPass.run a global project?** While initial partnerships may be focused on specific regions, our long-term vision is to expand the HealthPass network of partner hospitals and HPAi services globally.

**8. How does HealthPass ensure the security of its platform and NFTs?** We prioritize security through rigorous smart contract audits by third-party firms, adherence to blockchain security best practices, and secure infrastructure for our platform. Details are in the "Blockchain & Smart Contracts" and "Data Privacy and Security" sections.
