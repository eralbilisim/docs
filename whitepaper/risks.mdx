# Risk Factors

Participating in the HealthPass project and acquiring HealthPass NFTs involves various risks. Prospective participants should carefully consider these risks, alongside all other information in this Whitepaper, before making any decisions. The following is a non-exhaustive list of potential risks:

**1. Market & Volatility Risks:**

- **Price Volatility:** The value of HealthPass NFTs and any future \$HPT tokens can be highly volatile and may fluctuate significantly due to market demand, overall cryptocurrency market trends, project developments, and other factors. There is no guarantee of value retention or appreciation.
- **Liquidity Risk:** There may be limited liquidity for HealthPass NFTs on secondary markets, meaning you may not be able to sell your NFTs quickly or at your desired price.

**2. Project Development & Execution Risks:**

- **Development Delays:** The development of the HealthPass platform, HPAi technology, and \$HPT token may encounter unforeseen challenges, leading to delays in achieving roadmap milestones.
- **Failure to Achieve Objectives:** There is no guarantee that all aspects of the project, including the planned utility features (hospital discounts, HPAi revenue share), will be successfully implemented or achieve widespread adoption.
- **Competition:** The HealthTech and Web3 spaces are competitive. HealthPass may face competition from existing or new projects with similar offerings or superior technology.
- **Team Risk:** The success of the project depends on the continued dedication and performance of its core team. The loss of key team members could adversely affect the project.

**3. Technological Risks:**

- **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities:** Despite audits, smart contracts may contain unknown vulnerabilities or bugs that could be exploited, potentially leading to loss of funds or NFTs.
- **Blockchain Network Risks:** The project relies on the underlying blockchain network (e.g., [Your Chosen Blockchain]). Issues with this network, such as congestion, high transaction fees, security breaches, or forks, could negatively impact HealthPass.
- **HPAi Performance & Adoption:** The HPAi technology may not perform as expected, or it may fail to gain adoption by healthcare institutions, thereby impacting the revenue-sharing component.
- **Security Breaches:** The HealthPass platform or associated systems could be subject to hacking attempts, phishing scams, or other cyberattacks, potentially leading to data breaches or loss of assets.

**4. Regulatory & Legal Risks:**

- **Evolving Regulations:** The legal and regulatory framework for NFTs, cryptocurrencies, and AI in healthcare is uncertain and rapidly evolving. Future regulations could impose restrictions or obligations that adversely affect the project, its utility, or the ability to trade its assets.
- **Compliance Challenges:** Ensuring compliance with diverse and changing regulations across multiple jurisdictions can be complex and costly.
- **Data Privacy Regulations:** Failure to comply with data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) could result in significant penalties and reputational damage.

**5. Partnership Risks:**

- **Dependence on Hospital Partnerships:** The success of the discount utility relies heavily on establishing and maintaining partnerships with hospitals and healthcare providers. Failure to secure or retain these partnerships could diminish the NFT's value.
- **Third-Party Performance:** The project may depend on the performance and reliability of third-party service providers, whose failure could disrupt operations.

**6. Financial & Funding Risks:**

- **Adequacy of Funds:** While mint proceeds and royalties are planned for project development, unforeseen expenses or slower-than-expected revenue generation could lead to funding challenges.
- **HPAi Revenue Uncertainty:** The revenue generated by HPAi is not guaranteed and depends on market adoption and performance. This directly impacts the HPAi revenue share for NFT holders.

**7. General Risks Associated with Digital Assets:**

- **Loss of Private Keys:** If you lose access to your private keys for your Web3 wallet, you will lose access to your HealthPass NFTs and any associated tokens, and these cannot be recovered.
- **Scams and Fraud:** The cryptocurrency and NFT space is susceptible to scams, phishing, and other fraudulent activities. Participants must exercise extreme caution.

**8. Unforeseen Risks:**

- There may be other risks that are not currently foreseen or that are deemed immaterial at present but could become material in the future.

Prospective participants are strongly urged to conduct their own thorough research and consult with independent financial, legal, and tax advisors before acquiring HealthPass NFTs. You should only participate if you understand and are prepared to accept the risks involved.
