# Royalty Distribution and Usage

HealthPass NFTs are designed to be tradable on secondary NFT marketplaces. A royalty fee will be applied to all secondary market sales, and these funds will play a vital role in the ongoing sustainability and enhancement of the HealthPass ecosystem and its benefits to NFT holders.

## Royalty Mechanism:

- **Percentage Fee:** A fixed percentage (e.g., 5-10%, to be finalized before mint) will be automatically collected as a royalty from each secondary sale of a HealthPass NFT on compatible marketplaces.
- **Smart Contract Enforced:** This royalty mechanism will be embedded within the NFT's smart contract, ensuring its consistent application where supported by marketplaces.

## Utilization of Royalty Income:

The royalty income collected will be strategically allocated to the following key areas:

1. **Sustaining and Enhancing Hospital Discounts:**
   - **Primary Use:** A significant portion of royalty income will be used to ensure the long-term viability and attractiveness of the hospital discount program. This may involve:
     - Subsidizing discounts to maintain competitive rates for NFT holders.
     - Funding agreements with new healthcare providers to expand the network.
     - Negotiating improved discount terms with existing partners.
   - **Impact:** Guarantees that the core utility of the NFTs remains strong and appealing over time.
2. **Funding Community Events & Holder Benefits:**
   - **Purpose:** To enrich the experience of HealthPass NFT holders and foster a vibrant community.
   - **Examples:**
     - Organizing exclusive online and offline events (seminars, workshops, AMAs).
     - Developing educational content on health, wellness, and Web3.
     - Providing additional perks or airdrops to loyal holders.
     - Funding community-led initiatives (if a DAO structure is implemented).
   - **Impact:** Increases holder engagement, satisfaction, and the overall value proposition of being part of the HealthPass community.
3. **Supporting HPAi Operations & Revenue Share Program:**
   - **Purpose:** To ensure the smooth operation of the HPAi system and the integrity of its revenue-sharing mechanism.
   - **Examples:**
     - Covering ongoing operational costs of HPAi (server maintenance, data processing).
     - Funding further research and development to improve HPAi capabilities.
     - Potentially supplementing the HPAi revenue pool for distribution to NFT holders during initial ramp-up phases.
   - **Impact:** Strengthens the technological core of the project and the reliability of its revenue-sharing promise.
4. **Long-Term Project Development & Ecosystem Growth:**
   - **Purpose:** To reinvest in the continuous improvement and expansion of the HealthPass project.
   - **Examples:**
     - Exploring new utility features for the NFTs.
     - Expanding into new geographical markets.
     - Marketing and business development efforts.
   - **Impact:** Drives innovation and ensures the project remains competitive and relevant in the evolving Web3 and HealthTech landscapes.

## Transparency:

The allocation and use of royalty funds will be communicated to the community periodically, aligning with our commitment to transparency. This sustainable funding model, driven by secondary market activity, is designed to create a positive feedback loop, where a thriving ecosystem and valuable NFTs lead to more trading, which in turn generates more resources to further enhance the ecosystem.
