# Data Privacy and Security: Our Utmost Priority

At HealthPass.run, we recognize the extreme sensitivity of health-related data and are unequivocally committed to upholding the highest standards of data privacy and security across our ecosystem, particularly in relation to our HPAi (Health Artificial Intelligence) system.

## Guiding Principles:

1.  **Privacy by Design:** Privacy considerations are embedded into the design and development of all our systems and services from the outset.
2.  **Data Minimization:** We will only collect and process data that is strictly necessary for the provision of our services and the functioning of HPAi.
3.  **Anonymization & Pseudonymization:**
    *   **HPAi Training & Operation:** All medical data (images, lab results) used for training and operating HPAi will be **rigorously anonymized or pseudonymized** before being accessed by the AI models. This involves removing or encrypting all Directly Identifiable Information (DII) and Quasi-Identifiers to prevent re-identification of individuals.
    *   **No Personal Health Information (PHI) on Public Blockchains:** Sensitive PHI will never be stored directly on public blockchains. NFT ownership is pseudonymous, linked to a wallet address, not directly to an individual's health records within our core system.
4.  **User Consent:** For any features that may involve processing personal data (e.g., future personalized health insights from HPAi), explicit, informed consent will be obtained from users. Users will have control over their data and the ability to opt-out.
5.  **Compliance with Regulations:** We are committed to complying with all applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations, including but not limited to:
    *   GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) in Europe.
    *   HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) in the United States, where applicable to our operations or partners.
    *   Local data protection laws in all jurisdictions where we operate or offer services.
6.  **Robust Security Measures:**
    *   **Encryption:** Data at rest and in transit will be protected using strong encryption standards.
    *   **Access Controls:** Strict access control mechanisms will be implemented to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive data, and only for legitimate purposes.
    *   **Secure Infrastructure:** Our systems will be hosted on secure, compliant cloud infrastructure with industry-standard security protections (firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, etc.).
    *   **Regular Security Audits & Penetration Testing:** We will conduct regular security assessments and penetration tests to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities.

## HPAi and Data:

*   **Data Sourcing:** Data for HPAi will be sourced from partner healthcare institutions under strict data sharing agreements that prioritize patient privacy and comply with all legal and ethical requirements.
*   **Anonymized Output:** Insights generated by HPAi for institutions will typically be based on anonymized, aggregated data patterns or provide support for de-identified individual cases presented by the institution.
*   **No Sale of Personal Data:** HealthPass.run will not sell individuals' personal health information to third parties.

## Transparency:

We will be transparent with our users about our data handling practices through clear privacy policies and terms of service.

Our commitment to data privacy and security is fundamental to building trust with our users and partners, and to the ethical development and deployment of health technologies like HPAi.
