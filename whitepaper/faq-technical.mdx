# Frequently Asked Questions - Technical

**1. Which blockchain will HealthPass NFTs and the future $HPT token be on?**
HealthPass NFTs will be minted on the **Solana** blockchain. The choice of blockchain for the $HPT token will be determined during its development phase, considering factors like scalability, security, and transaction costs.

**2. What kind of AI is HPAi (Health Artificial Intelligence)?**
HPAi utilizes advanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, specifically focusing on computer vision for medical image analysis (like MRIs and X-rays) and natural language processing or pattern recognition for lab result interpretation. It's designed as an assistive tool for medical professionals.

**3. How will HPAi revenue be distributed to NFT holders?**
A designated portion of the net revenue generated from HPAi services will be programmatically distributed to eligible HealthPass NFT holders via smart contracts. The distribution will be proportional to the NFT tier held and occur at regular intervals (e.g., monthly or quarterly).

**4. How is patient data privacy handled with HPAi?**
Patient data privacy is paramount. All data used to train and operate HPAi will be rigorously anonymized or pseudonymized, removing personal identifiers. HPAi is designed to work with de-identified data when providing analysis to institutions. We will comply with all relevant data protection regulations like GDPR and HIPAA. See the "Data Privacy and Security" section for more details.

**5. Are the HealthPass smart contracts audited?**
Yes. All smart contracts related to the NFT mint, HPAi revenue distribution, and future $HPT token will undergo comprehensive security audits by reputable, independent blockchain security firms before deployment. Audit reports will be made publicly available.

**6. What type of NFT standard will HealthPass use (e.g., ERC-721, ERC-1155)?**
We will use a standard appropriate for unique, utility-based NFTs, such as ERC-721 or ERC-1155 (or their equivalents on our chosen blockchain). The specific standard will be confirmed prior to the mint.

**7. How can I store my HealthPass NFT?**
You can store your HealthPass NFT in any Web3 wallet compatible with the [Your Chosen Blockchain] network and the chosen NFT standard. Popular examples include MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Phantom, etc., depending on the blockchain.

**8. How will the discount verification process work technically?**
The exact technical implementation will involve a secure method for healthcare providers to verify the authenticity and current ownership of a HealthPass NFT. This might involve a dedicated portal, API integration, or a mobile application that interacts with the holder's crypto wallet. The goal is a seamless and secure experience.
